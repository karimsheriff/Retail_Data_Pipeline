# Retail Data Pipeline Project

In this project, I built a robust data pipeline that extracts retail sales data from three different CSV files. The data was first ingested into a denormalized format within a Hive table as a staging layer. Afterward, I applied transformations and data modeling to store the data in a data warehouse (DWH) using a star schema format within another Hive database.

I then performed comprehensive analysis on the data using Hive queries and created visualizations in Power BI to uncover key insights and trends related to retail sales performance.
